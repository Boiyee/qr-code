  --font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
  --font-weight-normal: 400;
  --font-weight-bold: 700;
  --border-radius: 20px;
  --box-shadow: 0 25px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0477);
}
```

### Continued development

**I would love to focus more on Frontend Development for now**

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://github.com/Boiyee/Calculator) - This helped me with some of my css codes. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning frontend development.
- [Resource 2](https://github.com/Boiyee/Git_mastery) - This is an amazing approach when i was trying to understand more on git.
